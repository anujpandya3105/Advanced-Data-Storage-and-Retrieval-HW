# Advanced-Data-Storage-and-Retrieval-HW
The solution processes the Station and Measurements CSV files and solves the Data Engineering, DataBase Engineering, Climate Analysis and Exploration and Climate App sections of the assignment.

#Steps<br>
<li>Please run the file database_engineering in Jupyter notebook. This will create a sqlite database "hawaii" and 2 tables measurement and station. Additionally, these tables will be populated based on the data provided in the CSV files. All data has been cleaned (by dropping rows that have NaNs) before loading into the tables.<br>
<li>Next, run the file climate analysis in Jupyter notebook. This file analyses the data, plots graphs and also uses flask technology to 
display data from the database in JSON format. The flask application runs locally on your machine (127.0.0.1) on port 5000.<br>
<li>All images will get stored in the local folder where Jupyter is launched from.
